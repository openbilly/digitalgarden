I wanted to change my way of reading this year. But it seems that the new reading way is a good way, at least is not a a way for me. 

I was planning to read every words in the book and write the summary and learning notes, so that i could get every elements from the book. it is totally not funny, and i am going to give it up and switch back to the normal method i used to have.

First of all, just pick the book up and read it. there is no need to worry about you can learn a thing from the book or not. while you finished the book, you definitely can learn much more than you can imagine. 

How about feeling forgetting everything after the finished the book? it doesn't matter. you will forget everything you after all. don't focus on memorize things but focus on reflection. I think that sparkle of the reflection is enough. 

Maybe it is not a good way for everybody. But it's good for me. I just want to read some books and have fun.
